# PowerShell-Scripts-for-K5

Scripts (written in PowerShell 4) which use the PowerShell Function in athertonsp/K5-powershell-functions to manipulate VMs and Networks in Fujitsu K5 Cloud platform.

# Pre-requisities

You must have the K5 powerShell Functions downloaded and available (See https://github.com/athertonsp/k5-powershell-functions).

# Notes

The Scripts in this repository are of two types. Those with "int" are interactive scripts; they use a combination of CLI prompts and GUI "Out-GridView" dialogs, to collect the required information.

The non-interactive scripts require parameter input at the command line for the required values. 

The attached PDF describes use of all the scripts.
